# 7. Machine Learning Based Survival Models {.unnumbered}

Machine Learning (ML) based Survival Analysis refers to the application of various machine learning algorithms and techniques to predict survival outcomes and model time-to-event data. Traditional statistical survival models (like Cox Proportional Hazards) have strong assumptions (e.g., proportional hazards, linearity) that might not always hold in complex real-world datasets with high-dimensional features or non-linear relationships. ML-based approaches offer greater flexibility to capture these complexities.

The primary goals of ML-based survival analysis are similar to traditional methods:
1.  **Prediction:** Accurately predict the survival time or survival probability for new subjects.
2.  **Feature Importance:** Identify which features (covariates) are most influential in determining survival outcomes.
3.  **Handling Complex Data:** Address high-dimensional data, non-linear relationships, and interactions between features that traditional models might struggle with.

Here's an overview of different types of ML-based survival models:

## Tree-Based Models

These models leverage decision trees to partition the feature space and estimate survival.

*   **Survival Trees (e.g., CART for Survival):**
    *   **Description:** An extension of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) where the splitting criteria and leaf node predictions are adapted for survival data. Instead of predicting a class or a continuous value, leaf nodes often store a Kaplan-Meier curve or a mean survival time. Splits are chosen to maximize the difference in survival between child nodes.
    *   **Advantages:** Interpretability (for single trees), handles non-linear relationships, robust to outliers.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Can be unstable and prone to overfitting with single trees.

*   **Survival Forests (e.g., Random Survival Forests - RSF):**
    *   **Description:** An ensemble method that builds multiple survival trees on bootstrapped samples of the data and averages their predictions. Each tree is grown by considering a random subset of features at each split.
    *   **Advantages:** High predictive accuracy, handles high dimensionality, less prone to overfitting than single trees, can derive variable importance measures.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Less interpretable than single trees.
    *   **Key Concept:** Each tree in the forest outputs a "cumulative hazard function" or "survival function," which are then averaged across the forest for the final prediction.

*   **Gradient Boosting for Survival (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM adapted for survival):**
    *   **Description:** Builds an ensemble of weak prediction trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones. Loss functions are adapted for survival data (e.g., based on concordance index or survival likelihood).
    *   **Advantages:** Excellent predictive performance, can handle complex interactions, flexible.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Can be computationally intensive, requires careful tuning, less interpretable.

### 2. Neural Network-Based Models (Deep Survival Models)

These models use the power of deep learning to learn complex, non-linear relationships in survival data.

*   **DeepSurv:**
    *   **Description:** A neural network architecture that adapts the Cox proportional hazards loss function. It learns a non-linear function of the covariates that is proportional to the log-hazard.
    *   **Advantages:** Captures complex non-linear relationships, can handle high-dimensional data, leverages the power of deep learning.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Requires large datasets, can be a black box (less interpretable).

*   **DeepHit:**
    *   **Description:** A neural network that directly models the *conditional probability of an event occurring at a specific time point*. It does this by dividing the time axis into discrete intervals and training a multi-task neural network to predict the probability of an event in each interval, while also considering competing risks.
    *   **Advantages:** Can handle competing risks, provides more fine-grained time-specific predictions, good for discrete time-to-event data.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Increased complexity due to discretizing time.

*   **Survival RNNs/LSTMs:**
    *   **Description:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks adapted for survival analysis, particularly useful for longitudinal (time-series) data where patient features change over time.
    *   **Advantages:** Excellent for dynamic prediction using time-varying covariates, captures temporal dependencies.
    *   **Disadvantages:** More complex architecture, requires sequential data.

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)-Based Models

*   **Survival SVM (e.g., Rank SVM for Survival):**
    *   **Description:** Adapts the principles of Support Vector Machines to survival data. Instead of classifying or regressing, these models often focus on learning a ranking function that orders patients by their expected survival time, consistent with the observed (possibly censored) survival times. They typically optimize a pairwise ranking loss.
    *   **Advantages:** Handles high-dimensional data, good generalization properties.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Can be computationally expensive for large datasets, less directly interpretable as a survival function.

### 4. Ensemble Methods (beyond forests)

While random survival forests are an ensemble method, other general ensemble techniques can be adapted.

*   **Stacking/Meta-Learners:**
    *   **Description:** Combines predictions from multiple diverse survival models (e.g., a Cox model, a survival tree, a DeepSurv model) using another model (a meta-learner) to make the final prediction.
    *   **Advantages:** Often leads to improved predictive performance by leveraging the strengths of different base learners.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Increased complexity, difficult to interpret.

### How ML-based models often differ from traditional models:

*   **Assumptions:** ML models are typically less reliant on strong distributional or proportional hazards assumptions.
*   **Non-linearity & Interactions:** More adept at capturing complex, non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
*   **High-Dimensionality:** Better suited for datasets with a very large number of features.
*   **Interpretability:** Often less interpretable ("black box") than traditional models like the Cox model, although methods for feature importance (e.g., SHAP values, permutation importance) are being developed for ML survival models.
