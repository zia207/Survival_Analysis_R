#  Andersen-Gill (AG) Model {.unnumbered}

 Andersen-Gill (AG) Model

 The AG model is an extension of the Cox PH model that treats recurrent events as independent observations within a subject, adjusted for intra-subject correlation using a robust variance estimator (clustering by subject ID). It assumes that the hazard for each event depends on covariates and the time since the study start (or a reset time).

- **Key Features**:
  - **Data Format**: Uses the counting process format `(tstart, tstop, event)`, where each row represents a time interval for a subject, with `tstart` and `tstop` defining the interval and `event` indicating whether an event occurred at `tstop` (1 = event, 0 = censored).
  - **Assumption**: Baseline hazard is the same for all events within a subject, and events are conditionally independent given covariates. The robust variance accounts for correlation between events.
  - **Use Case**: When events are frequent and correlation between events is not the primary focus (e.g., repeated asthma attacks).
- **Hazard Function**: 

$$
h_i(t) = h_0(t) \exp(\beta' X_i(t)),
$$

where $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard, \( X_i(t) \) are covariates (possibly time-dependent), and \( \beta \) are the regression coefficients. The `cluster(id)` term adjusts standard errors for intra-subject correlation.
- **Strengths**: Flexible for time-dependent covariates; straightforward to implement.
- **Limitations**: Assumes the same baseline hazard for all events; may not fully capture event dependence.

### Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) Model

The PWP model accounts for event order by stratifying the hazard function by event number (e.g., first event, second event) or conditioning on the time since the previous event. Two versions exist:

  - **PWP-Total Time (PWP-TT)**: Time is measured from the study start (like AG), but the hazard is stratified by event number.
  - **PWP-Gap Time (PWP-GT)**: Time is reset to zero after each event, modeling the hazard for the time to the next event (gap time).
- **Key Features**:
  - **Data Format**: Similar to AG, uses `(tstart, tstop, event)`, but includes a `stratum` variable indicating event number (e.g., 1 for first event, 2 for second).
  - **Assumption**: The hazard function differs by event number (PWP-TT) or resets after each event (PWP-GT); accounts for event order explicitly.
  - **Use Case**: When event order matters (e.g., first vs. subsequent cancer recurrences).
- **Hazard Function**:

  - PWP-TT: 
  
$$
h_{ik}(t) = h_{0k}(t) \exp(\beta' X_i(t)),
$$    

where $h_{0k}(t)$ is the baseline hazard for the $k$-th event.

- PWP-GT: 

$$
h_{ik}(u) = h_{0k}(u) \exp(\beta' X_i(u)),
$$
where $u = t - t_{k-1}$ is the gap time since the previous event.

- **Strengths**: Explicitly models event order or gap times; better for ordered events with distinct hazards.
- **Limitations**: Requires sufficient events per stratum; more complex to interpret than AG.



### Frailty models

Fraitlty models  account for unobserved heterogeneity or clustering in survival data by introducing a random effect, termed "frailty." The frailty represents unobserved factors that influence the hazard of an event, such as unmeasured patient characteristics or clustering effects (e.g., patients within hospitals). These models are particularly useful for handling correlated survival times, such as in recurrent event data, clustered data (e.g., family studies), or multi-center trials.

$$
  h_{ij}(t) = z_j h_0(t) \exp(\beta' X_{ij}(t)),
$$
  where:
- $h_0(t)$): Baseline hazard (unspecified in semi-parametric models like Cox).
- $z_j$: Frailty term for cluster $j$, typically $z_j \sim \text{Gamma}(1, \theta)$ or $z_j \sim \text{Log-Normal}(0, \sigma^2)$.
- $X_{ij}(t)$: Covariates (possibly time-dependent).
- $\beta$: Regression coefficients.

### Computing CIF for Recurrent Events

The **Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF)** estimates the probability of experiencing a specific event type by time \( t \), accounting for competing events (e.g., censoring or other event types). For recurrent events, CIF can be adapted to estimate the cumulative probability of the \( k \)-th event or the expected number of events over time. However, standard CIF computation (via the `cmprsk` package) is typically designed for competing risks, not recurrent events. For recurrent events, we often compute the **mean cumulative function (MCF)**, which estimates the expected number of events per subject over time, as a more appropriate analog to CIF.

## Implementation in R with the Melanoma Dataset

The `Melanoma` dataset from the `MASS` package in R contains survival data for patients with malignant melanoma, including time to death or censoring, but it does not directly include recurrent events (e.g., multiple tumor recurrences). Since the dataset lacks explicit recurrent event data, I’ll simulate recurrent events (e.g., tumor recurrences) based on the survival time and covariates, which is a common approach for demonstration when real recurrent event data is unavailable. Below, I outline all steps to prepare the data, fit AG and PWP models, and compute the MCF (as a substitute for CIF) using the `survival` package. If you have a dataset with actual recurrent events, let me know, and I can adapt the code.

#### Step 1: Load Libraries and Data
```R
library(survival)
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)

# Load Melanoma dataset
data(Melanoma, package = "MASS")
melanoma <- Melanoma

# Inspect the dataset
head(melanoma)
```

**Dataset Description**:
- `time`: Survival time in days (time to death or censoring).
- `status`: 1 = death from melanoma, 2 = alive, 3 = death from other causes.
- `sex`: 1 = male, 0 = female.
- `age`: Age in years.
- `year`: Year of operation.
- `thickness`: Tumor thickness in mm.
- `ulcer`: 1 = ulceration present, 0 = absent.

#### Step 2: Simulate Recurrent Events
Since the `Melanoma` dataset does not include recurrent events, we simulate multiple tumor recurrences for each patient based on their survival time and covariates (e.g., higher `thickness` or `ulcer` increases recurrence risk). This is a simplified approach for illustration.

```R
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility

# Create a function to simulate recurrent events
simulate_recurrent <- function(id, time, status, thickness, ulcer) {
  # Assume up to 3 recurrences, with hazard increasing with thickness and ulcer
  n_events <- rpois(1, lambda = 0.5 + 0.1 * thickness + 0.5 * ulcer)  # Number of events
  n_events <- min(n_events, 3)  # Cap at 3 recurrences
  if (n_events == 0) return(data.frame(id = id, tstart = NA, tstop = NA, event = NA, stratum = NA))
  
  # Generate event times within the observed time
  event_times <- sort(runif(n_events, 0, time))
  tstart <- c(0, event_times[-n_events])
  tstop <- event_times
  event <- rep(1, n_events)
  stratum <- 1:n_events  # Event number for PWP
  if (status == 2) {  # If censored, last interval is censored
    tstart <- c(tstart, event_times[n_events])
    tstop <- c(tstop, time)
    event <- c(event, 0)
    stratum <- c(stratum, n_events + 1)
  } else {  # If death, last event is death
    tstart <- c(tstart, event_times[n_events])
    tstop <- c(tstop, time)
    event <- c(event, status == 1)
    stratum <- c(stratum, n_events + 1)
  }
  return(data.frame(id = id, tstart = tstart, tstop = tstop, event = event, stratum = stratum))
}

# Apply to dataset
melanoma_recurrent <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:nrow(melanoma), function(i) {
  with(melanoma[i, ], simulate_recurrent(i, time, status, thickness, ulcer))
})) %>% left_join(select(melanoma, id = row_number(), sex, age, thickness, ulcer), by = "id") %>%
  filter(!is.na(tstart))  # Remove empty rows

# Inspect the simulated dataset
head(melanoma_recurrent)
```

**Simulated Data Structure**:
- `id`: Patient identifier.
- `tstart`: Start of the time interval.
- `tstop`: End of the time interval.
- `event`: 1 = recurrence or death (if final event and `status == 1`), 0 = censored.
- `stratum`: Event number (1, 2, 3, etc.) for PWP models.
- `sex`, `age`, `thickness`, `ulcer`: Covariates carried over from the original dataset.

#### Step 3: Fit the Andersen-Gill Model
The AG model treats all events as part of a single counting process, adjusting for correlation via robust standard errors.

```R
# Fit AG model
ag_fit <- coxph(Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ thickness + ulcer + sex + age + cluster(id), 
                data = melanoma_recurrent)
summary(ag_fit)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Coefficients represent the log hazard ratios for covariates (e.g., `thickness`, `ulcer`) on the hazard of any event.
- The `cluster(id)` term adjusts standard errors for intra-subject correlation.

#### Step 4: Fit the Prentice-Williams-Peterson Models
- **PWP-Total Time (PWP-TT)**: Stratifies by event number, using total time from study start.
- **PWP-Gap Time (PWP-GT)**: Uses gap time (time since previous event).

```R
# PWP-TT model
pwp_tt_fit <- coxph(Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ thickness + ulcer + sex + age + strata(stratum), 
                    data = melanoma_recurrent)
summary(pwp_tt_fit)

# PWP-GT model (create gap time)
melanoma_recurrent <- melanoma_recurrent %>% 
  mutate(gap_time = tstop - tstart)
pwp_gt_fit <- coxph(Surv(gap_time, event) ~ thickness + ulcer + sex + age + strata(stratum), 
                    data = melanoma_recurrent)
summary(pwp_gt_fit)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **PWP-TT**: Coefficients are specific to each event stratum (e.g., first vs. second recurrence).
- **PWP-GT**: Models the hazard for the time to the next event, resetting time after each event.

#### Step 5: Compute the Mean Cumulative Function (MCF)
For recurrent events, the MCF estimates the expected number of events per subject over time, analogous to the CIF in competing risks. The `survfit()` function with `type = "mstate"` or manual MCF computation can be used.

```R
# Compute MCF using survfit for recurrent events
mcf_fit <- survfit(Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ 1, data = melanoma_recurrent, id = id)
plot(mcf_fit, fun = "cumhaz", xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "Mean Cumulative Events", 
     main = "Mean Cumulative Function for Recurrent Events")
```

**Alternative (Stratified by Group)**:
To compute MCF by a covariate (e.g., `ulcer`):
```R
mcf_fit_group <- survfit(Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ ulcer, data = melanoma_recurrent, id = id)
plot(mcf_fit_group, fun = "cumhaz", xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "Mean Cumulative Events", 
     col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1:2, 
     main = "MCF by Ulceration Status")
legend("topleft", legend = c("No Ulcer", "Ulcer"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1:2)
```

**Note**: The `cmprsk` package’s `cuminc()` function is designed for competing risks, not recurrent events, so it’s not directly applicable here. The MCF is the standard approach for recurrent events.

#### Step 6: Model Diagnostics
Check the proportional hazards assumption for the AG model:
```R
ag_zph <- cox.zph(ag_fit)
print(ag_zph)
plot(ag_zph)
```

For PWP models, check assumptions within each stratum:
```R
pwp_tt_zph <- cox.zph(pwp_tt_fit)
print(pwp_tt_zph)
```

If the PH assumption is violated (p-value < 0.05), consider time-varying coefficients or alternative models (e.g., Aalen’s additive model in the `timereg` package).

#### Step 7: Interpretation of Results
- **AG Model**: Provides a single hazard ratio for each covariate across all events. For example, a positive coefficient for `thickness` indicates that thicker tumors increase the hazard of recurrence.
- **PWP Models**: Provide event-specific hazard ratios. For example, `thickness` may have a stronger effect on the first recurrence than subsequent ones.
- **MCF**: The plot shows the expected number of recurrences over time. A steeper curve for `ulcer = 1` vs. `ulcer = 0` indicates higher recurrence rates for ulcerated tumors.

### Key Considerations
- **Data Preparation**: The `(tstart, tstop, event)` format is critical. Each subject has multiple rows, one per time interval, with covariates constant within intervals.
- **Simulation**: Since the `Melanoma` dataset lacks real recurrent events, the simulation assumes recurrences based on `thickness` and `ulcer`. In practice, use actual recurrence times from your data.
- **MCF vs. CIF**: For recurrent events, MCF is more appropriate than CIF, as CIF is typically for competing risks. If you need CIF for a specific event type (e.g., first recurrence vs. death), redefine `status` and use `cmprsk::cuminc()`.
- **Limitations**: The AG model assumes a common baseline hazard, which may not hold if event risks change over time. PWP models address this but require sufficient events per stratum.
- **Packages**: The `survival` package is sufficient for AG and PWP models. For MCF, `survfit()` with `id` is robust. The `timereg` package offers alternatives like Aalen’s model for non-proportional hazards.

### Example Output (Hypothetical)
For the AG model:
```R
Call:
coxph(formula = Surv(tstart, tstop, event) ~ thickness + ulcer + sex + age + cluster(id), data = melanoma_recurrent)

  coef exp(coef) se(coef) robust se      z Pr(>|z|)    
thickness  0.1521    1.1642   0.0456    0.0489  3.110  0.00188 ** 
ulcer      0.7894    2.2017   0.2103    0.2231  3.537  0.00040 ***
sex       -0.1234    0.8839   0.1987    0.2056 -0.600  0.54853    
age        0.0102    1.0103   0.0078    0.0081  1.259  0.20792    
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
```

- **Interpretation**: Higher tumor thickness and ulceration significantly increase the hazard of recurrence. Sex and age have non-significant effects.

For the MCF plot, expect a curve showing the cumulative number of recurrences, with steeper slopes for higher-risk groups (e.g., `ulcer = 1`).

### Additional Notes
- **Real Data**: If you have a dataset with actual recurrent events (e.g., times of tumor recurrences), replace the simulation step with your data in `(tstart, tstop, event)` format.
- **Competing Risks**: If you need CIF for competing events (e.g., recurrence vs. death), redefine the `status` variable (e.g., 1 = recurrence, 2 = death, 0 = censored) and use:
  ```R
  library(cmprsk)
  cif_fit <- cuminc(ftime = melanoma$time, fstatus = melanoma$status)
  plot(cif_fit, xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "Cumulative Incidence")
  ```
- **Resources**: See the `survival` vignette (`vignette("timedep", package = "survival")`) or “Applied Survival Analysis” by Hosmer, Lemeshow, and May for more details.

If you have specific data or want to focus on a particular aspect (e.g., real recurrent event data, specific covariates, or CIF for competing risks), please provide details, and I can refine the code or analysis!
