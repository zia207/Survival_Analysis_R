# 3.3 The Log-Normal Survival Model {.unnumbered}

This tutorial covers the Log-Normal survival model, including its theoretical background, implementation in R, and practical examples using the `survival` package. We will also address common pitfalls and provide diagnostic tools to assess model fit. 

## Overview

The Log-Normal survival model is a parametric model used in survival analysis where the logarithm of the survival time $T$, denoted $\ln(T)$, follows a normal distribution, i.e., $\ln(T) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$. Here, $\mu$ is the mean of the log-time (location parameter), and $\sigma > 0$ is the standard deviation (scale parameter). This model is part of the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) framework, where covariates scale the survival time multiplicatively, accelerating or decelerating the time to an event (e.g., death, failure).

### Key Features

- **Hazard Function**: Unlike the exponential or Weibull models, the log-normal model has a non-monotonic hazard function that typically increases to a peak and then decreases, making it suitable for scenarios where the risk rises initially (e.g., post-surgery complications) and later declines (e.g., recovery phase). For small $\sigma$, the hazard may be monotonically decreasing.
- **Applications**: Commonly used in medical research (e.g., time to disease recurrence), reliability engineering (e.g., component failure times), or economics (e.g., duration of unemployment) when survival times are positively skewed and hazards are arc-shaped.
- **Assumptions**: Assumes $\ln(T)$ is normally distributed, implying $T$ is log-normally distributed. This is appropriate when empirical hazard plots (e.g., from Kaplan-Meier) suggest a non-monotonic or decreasing hazard.
- **Limitations**: Not suitable for monotonically increasing hazards (use Weibull instead). It does not naturally fit a proportional hazards framework like the Cox model, though it can be adapted.


- **Probability Density Function (PDF)**:

$$
  f(t) = \frac{1}{t \sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( -\frac{(\ln(t) - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right), \quad t > 0
$$
  This describes the distribution of survival times, skewed to the right due to the log transformation.
  
- **Survival Function**:

$$
  S(t) = 1 - \Phi\left( \frac{\ln(t) - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
$$

  where $\Phi$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF). This gives the probability of surviving past time $t$.
  
- **Hazard Function**:

$$
  h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)} = \frac{\frac{1}{t \sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( -\frac{(\ln(t) - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)}{1 - \Phi\left( \frac{\ln(t) - \mu}{\sigma} \right)}
$$
  No closed form exists, but it typically rises to a peak and then falls (arc-shaped) for \( \sigma > 1 \), or is decreasing for \( \sigma \leq 1 \).
  
- **Mean and Variance**:

  - Mean: $E[T] = e^{\mu + \sigma^2/2}$
  - Variance: $\text{Var}(T) = e^{2\mu + \sigma^2} (e^{\sigma^2} - 1)$

### When to Use

Choose the log-normal model when:

- Nonparametric hazard estimates (e.g., from Kaplan-Meier or kernel smoothing) show an arc-shaped or decreasing hazard.
- Survival times are positively skewed, and log-transformation normalizes them.
- You prefer an AFT model to interpret covariate effects as time scaling (e.g., a positive coefficient extends survival time).

### Model Fit Assessment

- Use AIC/BIC to compare with other models (e.g., Weibull, exponential).
- Check residuals (e.g., Cox-Snell) or compare fitted survival curves to Kaplan-Meier estimates.
- Validate the log-normal assumption with Q-Q plots of log-times or hazard shape diagnostics.

## Implementation in R

This tutorial demonstrates fitting a log-normal survival model using R’s `survival` package, with diagnostics to assess model fit. We’ll use the `lung` dataset from `survival`, which contains survival times for lung cancer patients. The code includes data preparation, model fitting, predictions, plotting, and diagnostics, addressing lessons from your previous queries (e.g., handling `status`, centering covariates, and robust plotting).

### Install Required R Packages

Following R packages are required to run this notebook. If any of these packages are not installed, you can install them using the code below:

```{r}
packages <-c(
		 'tidyverse',
		 'survival',
		 'flexsurv',
		 'survminer',
		 'ggsurvfit',
		 'tidycmprsk',
		 'ggfortify',
		 'timereg',
		 'cmprsk',
		 'condSURV',
		 'riskRegression'
		 )

```

``` 
#| warning: false
#| error: false

# Install missing packages
new_packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)

devtools::install_github("ItziarI/WeDiBaDis")

# Verify installation
cat("Installed packages:\n")
print(sapply(packages, requireNamespace, quietly = TRUE))
```

### Load Packages

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| error: false
# Load packages with suppressed messages
invisible(lapply(packages, function(pkg) {
  suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(pkg, character.only = TRUE))
}))
```

```{r}
# Check loaded packages
cat("Successfully loaded packages:\n")
print(search()[grepl("package:", search())])
```


### Data Preparation


```{R}
data("lung", package = "survival")
# Recode status: 1 = censored (0), 2 = dead (1)
lung$status <- lung$status - 1

# Create survival object
surv_object <- Surv(time = lung$time, event = lung$status)
```

### Model Fitting

- **Null Model**: `lnorm_model` fits a baseline log-normal model (`~ 1`).
- **Covariate Model**: `lnorm_model_cov` includes `age_centered` and `sex`. Coefficients represent shifts in $\mu$ (log-time); positive values extend survival time.
- **Output**: `summary(lnorm_model_cov)` shows $\mu$ (Intercept), coefficients, and $\sigma$ (Scale).

```{R}
# Create survival object
surv_object <- Surv(time = lung$time, event = lung$status)

# Fit log-normal models
lnorm_model <- survreg(surv_object ~ 1, data = lung, dist = "lognormal")
lnorm_model_cov <-  survreg(Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex, data = lung, dist = "lognormal")
print("Model summary (with covariates):")
summary(lnorm_model_cov)
```

### Predictions

- **Median Time**: `type = "response"` returns $e^\mu$, the median survival time for the log-normal model.
- **Survival Probability**: Uses `plnorm` with `lower.tail = FALSE` to compute $S(t) = P(T > t)$.


```{R}
# Prediction for new data (60-year-old male)
new_data <- data.frame(age = 60 - mean(lung$age), sex = 1)
median_time <- predict(lnorm_model_cov, newdata = new_data, type = "response")
print("Median survival time (days):")
print(median_time)
```

#### Plotting

- **Survival Curve**: Compares Kaplan-Meier to the log-normal survival curve. A close match suggests good fit.
- **Lessons from Prior Errors**: Avoids issues like the `lines` error (`'x' and 'y' lengths differ`) by using a single curve with `t_seq` and `surv_lnorm`.


```{R}
#| fig.width: 5.5
#| fig.height: 5
# Survival probability at t=500 days
surv_prob <- plnorm(500, meanlog = predict(lnorm_model_cov, newdata = new_data, type = "lp"), 
                    sdlog = lnorm_model_cov$scale, lower.tail = FALSE)
print("Survival probability at t=500 days:")
print(surv_prob)

# Plot Kaplan-Meier and log-normal curve (null model)
km_fit <- survfit(surv_object ~ 1)
plot(km_fit, main = "Kaplan-Meier vs Log-Normal Survival Curve", 
     xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "Survival Probability", 
     col = "black", lwd = 2)
t_seq <- seq(0, max(lung$time), length.out = 100)
mu <- coef(lnorm_model)[1]
sigma <- lnorm_model$scale
surv_lnorm <- plnorm(t_seq, meanlog = mu, sdlog = sigma, lower.tail = FALSE)
lines(t_seq, surv_lnorm, col = "red", lwd = 2)
legend("topright", c("Kaplan-Meier", "Log-Normal"), col = c("black", "red"), lwd = 2)
```

haz_lnorm <- summary(flex_lnorm, newdata = new_data, type = "hazard", tidy = TRUE)
ggplot(haz_lnorm, aes(x = time, y = est)) +
  geom_line(col = "blue", lwd = 1) +
  ggtitle("Log-Normal Hazard Function (for new data)") +
  xlab("Time (days)") + ylab("Hazard Rate")
```



## Summary and Conclusion

The Log-Normal survival model is a powerful parametric approach for analyzing time-to-event data, particularly when the hazard function is non-monotonic. By assuming that the logarithm of survival times follows a normal distribution, this model provides a flexible framework for understanding how covariates influence survival times through an Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) perspective.
