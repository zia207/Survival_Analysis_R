    "**Cox Regression**, also known as the **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**, is a statistical technique widely used in survival analysis to study the relationship between survival time (time-to-event) and one or more predictor variables (covariates). Developed by Sir David Cox in 1972, this semi-parametric model is particularly useful because it does not require the specification of a baseline hazard function, making it flexible for analyzing survival data.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Key Concepts of Cox Regression***:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Hazard Function**:\n",
    "    -   The hazard function $h(t)$ represents the instantaneous rate at which events occur at time $t$, given that the subject has survived up to time $t$. It can be thought of as the risk of an event occurring in the next instant of time.\n",
    "2.  **Proportional Hazards Assumption**:\n",
    "    -   The key assumption of Cox regression is that the hazard ratios between different levels of the covariates are **proportional** over time. This means that the effect of the covariates on survival is constant and does not change as time progresses.\n",
    "3.  **Semi-parametric Model**:\n",
    "    -   The Cox model is called semi-parametric because it does not require a specific form for the baseline hazard function, ( h_0(t) ), making it flexible. It estimates the effect of covariates on the hazard function while leaving the baseline hazard unspecified.\n",
    "4.  **Hazard Ratio (HR)**:\n",
    "    -   The model estimates the **hazard ratio**, which quantifies the effect of a covariate on the hazard. A hazard ratio of:\n",
    "        -   **HR = 1**: No effect (covariate does not influence the risk).\n",
    "        -   **HR \\> 1**: Increased hazard (higher risk of the event).\n",
    "        -   **HR \\< 1**: Decreased hazard (lower risk of the event).\n",
    "\n",
    "***Cox Proportional Hazards Model Equation:***\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cox model can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h(t|X) = h_0(t) \\cdot \\exp(\\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where: - $h(t|X)$ is the hazard at time $t$ for an individual with covariates $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p$. - $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function (the hazard when all covariates are zero). - $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p$ are the coefficients that quantify the effect of each covariate on the hazard. - $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p$ are the covariates (predictors or risk factors).\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity $\\exp(\\beta)$ is the hazard ratio (HR) for each covariate, which represents the relative risk associated with a one-unit increase in that covariate.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Steps in Cox Regression***:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Model Fitting**: Fit the Cox model to the survival data by estimating the regression coefficients $\\beta$ for the covariates.\n",
    "2.  **Estimate Hazard Ratios**: Compute the hazard ratios $\\exp(\\beta)$, which tell how much the risk of the event changes with a one-unit increase in each covariate.\n",
    "3.  **Check the Proportional Hazards Assumption**: Verify if the proportional hazards assumption holds by assessing whether the hazard ratios remain constant over time.\n",
    "4.  **Interpretation**: Interpret the hazard ratios to understand how the covariates influence the time to event.\n"

    "To fit a Cox Proportional Hazards Model manually using the simulated lung dataset, we need to go through several steps. Although R provides easy-to-use packages like {survival} to fit the model, we'll manually implement the Cox model based on its theoretical foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Steps for Fitting Cox Proportional Hazards Model Manually***\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Formulate the Model**: The Cox proportional hazards model estimates the effect of covariates (like age, sex, etc.) on the hazard rate. The model can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ h(t | X) = h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   $h(t | X)$ is the hazard at time $t$ given covariates $X$,\n",
    "    -   $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard (which is left unspecified),\n",
    "    -   $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p$ are the coefficients to be estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Partial Likelihood**: The Cox model uses partial likelihood instead of a full likelihood function, which does not require estimating the baseline hazard function. The partial likelihood for a sample with censored data is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\beta) = \\prod_{i: \\delta_i = 1} \\frac{\\exp(\\beta^T X_i)}{\\sum_{j \\in R(t_i)} \\exp(\\beta^T X_j)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $R(t_i)$ is the risk set at time $t_i$ (individuals at risk of the event at time (t_i)),\n",
    "-   $\\delta_i$ is an indicator (1 if the event occurs, 0 if censored).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Estimation**: The log-partial likelihood is maximized to estimate the coefficients $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Score and Information Matrix**: Use the score function (first derivative) and the observed information matrix (second derivative) to apply Newton-Raphson optimization to find the maximum likelihood estimates for (\\beta).\n",
    "\n",
    "This manual method demonstrates the key steps in Cox model estimation without relying on built-in R packages like `survival`. It replicates what the `coxph()` function would do under the hood.\n"
