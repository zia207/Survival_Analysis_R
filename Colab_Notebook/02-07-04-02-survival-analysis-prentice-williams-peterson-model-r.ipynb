    "Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) models are extensions of the Cox proportional hazards model specifically designed for analyzing recurrent event data, where the same type of event (e.g., infections, hospitalizations, or tumor recurrences) can occur multiple times for an individual. Unlike standard survival analysis for single events, PWP models account for the ordering and dependency of repeated events by stratifying the analysis based on the number of prior events. This stratification creates conditional risk sets: all subjects are at risk for the first event, but only those who experienced the first are at risk for the second, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "PWP models are particularly useful in epidemiology and clinical studies, such as tracking recurrent infections in patients with chronic conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis or kidney disease) or repeated sports injuries. They allow for event-specific covariate effects, meaning the impact of predictors like treatment or age can vary across event orders. However, if the number of events is large, risk sets for later events may become small, leading to unstable estimates—often requiring truncation (e.g., analyzing only the first 3-4 events).\n",

    "There are two main variants:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **PWP-TT (Total Time or Conditional Risk Set Model)**: Measures time from study entry to each event, similar to calendar time. It's suitable when the overall timeline matters, and it assumes a common baseline hazard within each stratum (event order) but allows covariate effects to differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **PWP-GT (Gap Time Model)**: Measures the time between consecutive events (inter-event gaps), resetting the clock after each event. This assumes a renewal process and is ideal for focusing on waiting times between recurrences, such as predicting the time to the next event.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Time Scale | Interpretation |\n",
    "|----|----|----|\n",
    "| **PWP-GT (Gap Time)** | Time since *previous* event | \"What is the risk of the *k*-th event given the (*k–1*)-th occurred?\" |\n",
    "| **PWP-TT (Total Time)** | Time since *study entry* | \"What is the risk of the *k*-th event at calendar time *t*?\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "The PWP model **stratifies by event number** (1st event, 2nd event, etc.), allowing the baseline hazard to differ across event orders. This acknowledges that the risk of a second event may differ from the first due to biological, behavioral, or mechanical factors.\n"
