Developed by Sir David Cox in 1972, this semi-parametric model is particularly useful because it does not require the specification of a baseline hazard function, making it flexible for analyzing survival data.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Hazard Function**:\n",
        "    -   The hazard function $h(t)$ represents the instantaneous rate at which events occur at time $t$, given that the subject has survived up to time $t$. It can be thought of as the risk of an event occurring in the next instant of time.\n",
        "2.  **Proportional Hazards Assumption**:\n",
        "    -   The key assumption of Cox regression is that the hazard ratios between different levels of the covariates are **proportional** over time. This means that the effect of the covariates on survival is constant and does not change as time progresses.\n",
        "3.  **Semi-parametric Model**:\n",
        "    -   The Cox model is called semi-parametric because it does not require a specific form for the baseline hazard function, ( h_0(t) ), making it flexible. It estimates the effect of covariates on the hazard function while leaving the baseline hazard unspecified.\n",
        "4.  **Hazard Ratio (HR)**:\n",
        "    -   The model estimates the **hazard ratio**, which quantifies the effect of a covariate on the hazard. A hazard ratio of:\n",
        "        -   **HR = 1**: No effect (covariate does not influence the risk).\n",
        "        -   **HR \\> 1**: Increased hazard (higher risk of the event).\n",
        "        -   **HR \\< 1**: Decreased hazard (lower risk of the event).\n",
        "\n",
        "***Cox Proportional Hazards Model Equation:***\n",
        "\n",
        "The Cox model can be written as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ h(t|X) = h_0(t) \\cdot \\exp(\\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where: - $h(t|X)$ is the hazard at time $t$ for an individual with covariates $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p$. - $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function (the hazard when all covariates are zero). - $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p$ are the coefficients that quantify the effect of each covariate on the hazard. - $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p$ are the covariates (predictors or risk factors).\n",
        "\n",
        "The quantity $\\exp(\\beta)$ is the hazard ratio (HR) for each covariate, which represents the relative risk associated with a one-unit increase in that covariate.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Steps in Cox Regression***:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Model Fitting**: Fit the Cox model to the survival data by estimating the regression coefficients $\\beta$ for the covariates.\n",
        "2.  **Estimate Hazard Ratios**: Compute the hazard ratios $\\exp(\\beta)$, which tell how much the risk of the event changes with a one-unit increase in each covariate.\n",
        "3.  **Check the Proportional Hazards Assumption**: Verify if the proportional hazards assumption holds by assessing whether the hazard ratios remain constant over time.\n",
        "4.  **Interpretation**: Interpret the hazard ratios to understand how the covariates influence the time to event.\n"
