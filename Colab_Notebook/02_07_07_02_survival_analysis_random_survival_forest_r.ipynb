    "Survival Forests combine the principles of Random Forests with survival analysis. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival data consists of: - **Features**: $X = (X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p)$, a vector of predictors (e.g., age, blood pressure, treatment type).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event Time: $T$, the time to the event (or censoring time if the event doesn’t occur).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Censoring Indicator: $\\delta$, where $\\delta = 1$ if the event is observed, and $\\delta = 0$ if the observation is censored (e.g., patient lost to follow-up).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset: $\\{(X_i, T_i, \\delta_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, for $n$ observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimate the survival function $S(t) = P(T > t)$, the probability of surviving past time $t$, or the cumulative hazard function $H(t) = \\int_0^t h(u) \\, du$, where $h(t)$ is the hazard rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bootstrap Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival Forests use the Random Forest principle of ensemble learning: - **Draw Bootstrap Samples**: For each of $B$ trees, randomly sample $n$ observations **with replacement** from the dataset. This creates a bootstrap sample $D_b = \\{(X_i, T_i, \\delta_i)\\}_{i \\in S_b}$, where $S_b$ is the set of indices for tree ( b ).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Out-of-Bag (OOB) Data: Observations not included in the bootstrap sample for a tree are used for validation or error estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Build Survival Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree is constructed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Start at the Root Node:\n",
    "\n",
    "   -   The root contains the bootstrap sample $D_b$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   -   Select a random subset of features (e.g., $m = \\sqrt{p}$ features, where $p$ is the total number of features).\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Node Splitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "  -   For each node, evaluate possible splits on the selected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "  -   A split divides the node into two child nodes based on a feature $X_j$ and threshold $s$, e.g., $X \\leq s$ (left child) and $X_j > s$ (right child).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Choose the split that maximizes a survival-specific criterion, typically the **log-rank statistic**, which tests whether survival distributions differ between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Log-Rank Statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For a split at time $t$, let:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   $d_{i1}$: Number of events in the left child at time $t_i$.\n",
    "        -   $n_{i1}$: Number of individuals at risk in the left child just before $t_i$.\n",
    "        -   $d_i$: Total events at $t_i$ in the parent node.\n",
    "        -   $n_i$: Total individuals at risk in the parent node.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Expected events in the left child under the null hypothesis (no difference in survival):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e_{i1} = \\frac{n_{i1}}{n_i} \\cdot d_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  -   The log-rank statistic is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\chi^2 = \\sum_{t_i} \\frac{(d_{i1} - e_{i1})^2}{\\text{Var}(d_{i1} - e_{i1})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where the variance is approximated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\text{Var}(d_{i1} - e_{i1}) \\approx \\frac{n_{i1} \\cdot (n_i - n_{i1}) \\cdot d_i \\cdot (n_i - d_i)}{n_i^2 \\cdot (n_i - 1)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   -   Choose the split (feature $X_j$, threshold $s$ that maximizes $\\chi^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Grow the Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Recursively apply the splitting process to each child node until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., minimum node size, maximum depth, or insufficient events).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Each leaf node contains a subset of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Leaf Node Estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For each leaf node, compute the **Nelson-Aalen estimator** for the cumulative hazard function (CHF) using the observations in that leaf:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{H}(t) = \\sum_{t_i \\leq t} \\frac{d_i}{n_i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "        where:\n",
    "\n",
    "   -   $t_i$: Distinct event times in the leaf.\n",
    "   -   $d_i$: Number of events ($\\delta_i = 1$) at time $t_i$.\n",
    "   -   $n_i$: Number of individuals at risk just before $t_i$ (those with $T_i \\geq t_i$).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The survival function for the leaf is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\hat{S}(t) = e^{-\\hat{H}(t)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Aggregate Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "For each observation $X$, the Survival Forest aggregates predictions across all $B$ trees: - Pass $X$ through each tree $b = 1, \\dots, B$ to find the leaf node it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieve the CHF $\\hat{H}_b(t)$ from the leaf node of tree $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the ensemble CHF by averaging:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{H}(t) = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^B \\hat{H}_b(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The ensemble survival function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{S}(t) = e^{-\\hat{H}(t)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, some implementations average survival functions directly or use other aggregation methods, but the CHF is most common due to its stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Handling Censoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Censoring is a key challenge in survival analysis. Survival Forests handle it by: - Including both censored ($\\delta = 0$) and uncensored ($\\delta = 1$) observations in the \"at-risk\" set $n_i$ until their event or censoring time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only uncensored events contribute to $d_i$ in the Nelson-Aalen estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The log-rank statistic accounts for censoring by considering the expected number of events under the null hypothesis, adjusted for the at-risk population.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Prediction for New Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For a new observation with features $X_{\\text{new}}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Pass $X_{\\text{new}}$ through each of the $B$ trees to find the corresponding leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Retrieve the CHF $\\hat{H}_b(t)$ from each tree’s leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Compute the ensemble CHF:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\hat{H}(t) = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^B \\hat{H}_b(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Compute the survival function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{S}(t) = e^{-\\hat{H}(t)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Optionally, compute the hazard function $h(t)$ by taking the derivative of $H(t)$, though this is less common in practice.\n",
    "\n",

It’s widely used in fields like medicine and engineering but requires computational resources and careful tuning. This tutorial demonstrated how to implement Survival Forests in R using the `randomForestSRC`, `ranger`, and `DynForest` packages, covering data preparation, model fitting, evaluation metrics (C-index, Brier Score, CRPS), variable importance, and visualization techniques. This help researchers and practitioners effectively apply Survival Forests to their survival analysis tasks. \n"
