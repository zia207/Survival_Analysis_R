    " The AG model is an extension of the Cox PH model that treats recurrent events as independent observations within a subject, adjusted for intra-subject correlation using a robust variance estimator (clustering by subject ID). It assumes that the hazard for each event depends on covariates and the time since the study start (or a reset time).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - **Data Format**: Uses the counting process format `(tstart, tstop, event)`, where each row represents a time interval for a subject, with `tstart` and `tstop` defining the interval and `event` indicating whether an event occurred at `tstop` (1 = event, 0 = censored).\n",
    "  - **Assumption**: Baseline hazard is the same for all events within a subject, and events are conditionally independent given covariates. The robust variance accounts for correlation between events.\n",
    "  - **Use Case**: When events are frequent and correlation between events is not the primary focus (e.g., repeated asthma attacks).\n",
