        "A **Gradient Boosted Survival Model** is a machine learning approach that combines gradient boosting with survival analysis to predict the time until an event of interest occurs, such as failure, death, or churn. Survival models deal with time-to-event data, which is often censored (i.e., the event hasn’t occurred for some subjects during the observation period). Gradient boosting enhances these models by iteratively building an ensemble of weak learners (typically decision trees) to minimize a loss function tailored to survival data.\n",

        "There are several types of gradient boosted survival models, each tailored to specific survival analysis frameworks or assumptions. Thee most widely used models are **Cox Proportional Hazards-Based Gradient Boosting (CoxBoost)**,  **Gradient Boosting Survival Tree (GBST)**, and **Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) Gradient Boosting**. CoxBoost and GBST are fundamentally very similar, and in many contexts, GBST is simply a specific implementation of CoxBoost using decision trees as base learners. Coxboost can use various weak learners (trees, linear models, etc.), however, GBST is specifically designed for survival analysis and uses survival-specific splitting criteria in the trees. AFT Gradient Boosting, on the other hand, models the log-survival time directly and is based on a different assumption about how covariates affect survival time.\n",

        "The Cox Proportional Hazards-Based Gradient Boosting Model combines the Cox proportional hazards framework with gradient boosting to model survival data, capturing non-linear relationships and interactions while handling censored observations. In R, packages like {CoxBoost}, {xgboost}, and {gbm} enable this approach. Below is a step-by-step implementation of CoxBoost model, including data preparation, model fitting, validation, and visualization.  It is a semi-parametric regression model widely used for such tasks. The classical Cox model assumes:\n",

        "- Proportional hazards\n",
        "\n",
        "- No interactions unless explicitly added\n",
        "\n",
        "To overcome these limitations, **gradient boosting** can be adapted to optimize the **partial likelihood** of the Cox model. This results in a **boosted Cox model** that learns complex, non-linear patterns in the data by sequentially fitting weak learners (typically decision trees) to improve survival risk predictions. This approach is implemented in libraries like `CoxBoost`,  `gbm` and `xgboost` using a custom objective function based on the **Cox partial log-likelihood**.\n"

        "GBST applies gradient boosting directly to survival data using tree-based models, but it typically uses `rank-based` or `log-likelihood` loss functions tailored to survival, such as the log partial likelihood (Cox-type) or concordance-based loss. It extends the gradient boosting framework—popularized by algorithms like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and XGBoost—to handle survival outcomes by optimizing survival-specific loss functions. Unlike traditional survival models such as the **Cox proportional hazards model**, GBST does not assume proportional hazards. GBST can capture complex, non-linear relationships and interactions in the data. GBST may use different loss functions (e.g., ranking), while CoxBoost specifically targets the Cox partial likelihood.\n",

This approach allows for flexible modeling of survival times while accounting for censoring. The AFT model can be implemented using gradient boosting techniques, which iteratively fit weak learners to improve predictions. In R, packages like {gbm} and {xgboost} can be used to implement AFT models with custom loss functions. Below is a step-by-step guide to fitting an AFT Gradient Boosting model, including data preparation, model fitting, validation, and visualization.\n"

This approach can be particularly useful when standard loss functions do not adequately represent the underlying survival process. In R, packages like {xgboost} and {gbm} can be used to implement survival gradient boosting with custom loss functions.

        "**CoxBoost** model extends the Cox proportional hazards model using gradient boosting to model the log-hazard function. It assumes proportional hazards and optimizes the negative log-partial likelihood. The notebook demonstrates its implementation using the `{CoxBoost}` package, including data preparation, model fitting, cross-validation for penalty and steps, prediction, and evaluation using C-index and Integrated Brier Score (IBS).\n",
        "\n",
        "**GBST (Gradient Boosting Survival Trees)** is a generic framework that applies gradient boosting to survival data using tree-based models and survival-specific loss functions. CoxBoost is a special case of GBST. The notebook shows implementations using both the `{gbm}` package (with `distribution = \"coxph\"`) and the `{xgboost}` package (with `objective = \"survival:cox\"`), covering data preparation, model fitting, cross-validation (for `{gbm}`), variable importance, prediction, and evaluation with C-index and IBS.\n",
        "\n",
        "**AFTBoost (Accelerated Failure Time Gradient Boosting)**  models the logarithm of the survival time as a linear function of covariates, assuming predictors accelerate or decelerate the time to an event. The notebook demonstrates its implementation using the `{xgboost}` package (with `objective = \"survival:aft\"`), including data preparation (using `label_lower_bound` and `label_upper_bound`), model fitting, variable importance, prediction of log-survival times, and evaluation with C-index and IBS.\n",

        "The notebook successfully demonstrates the implementation of three different gradient boosted survival models in R using the `{CoxBoost}`, `{gbm}`, and `{xgboost}` packages. Each model offers a distinct approach to survival analysis, with CoxBoost and GBST focusing on hazard-based modeling (often using the Cox partial likelihood) and AFTBoost directly modeling survival times. The examples provided cover essential steps like data preparation, model fitting, hyperparameter tuning (through cross-validation), assessing variable importance, and evaluating model performance using metrics like C-index and IBS. The visualizations of survival curves offer insights into the models' predictions. The notebook serves as a valuable introduction to applying gradient boosting techniques to time-to-event data in R.\n",
