    "The {joineR} package is designed to facilitate the analysis of data from longitudinal studies, which involve collecting multiple measurements over time from the same subjects. Each subject’s data consists of a series of repeated measurements as well as a potentially censored time-to-event outcome, such as the time until a particular event occurs. To model the repeated measurements, the package utilizes a linear model that incorporates random effects, allowing for the analysis of individual variations over time. Additionally, a correlated error structure can be included to account for any dependencies among the measurements. For the time-to-event outcomes, the modeling framework employs a Cox proportional hazards model augmented with log-Gaussian frailty. This approach enables the analysis of the effects of covariates on the timing of events while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity among subjects. A key feature of this framework is the ability to capture stochastic dependence between the two components of the model. Specifically, it allows the Gaussian random effects from the linear model—representing subject-specific variations—to be correlated with the frailty term in the Cox proportional hazards model. This correlation can provide deeper insights into the relationships between the repeated measurements and the timing of events, leading to more comprehensive and nuanced interpretations of the\n"

    "The function `jointSE()` provides standard errors and confidence intervals for the parameters defining the mean response profiles in a random effects joint model. Currently, the calculation of standard errors for the random effect parameters is not implemented. However, approximate standard errors can be obtained through a parametric bootstrap, which involves re-estimating the model parameters from simulated realizations of the fitted model. The first two arguments for `jointSE()` are the results from calling the `joint()` function, with the corresponding `jointdata` object automatically stored as part of the model fit. The second argument allows you to specify the number of bootstrap samples to be taken. The remaining arguments are included for completeness; they mirror the last four arguments of the `joint()` function and provide an additional option to control the level of output displayed in the R terminal. Be aware that with a sufficiently large number of bootstrap samples, this function can be slow to execute. If you run the function with only 100 bootstrap samples, the output will reflect this number, and the confidence limits will default to zero unless at least 100 bootstrap samples are taken.\n"

    "This tutorial covered the essential concepts and practical applications of  Standard (Shared Random Effects) Joint model of longitudinal and time-to-event data in R. We began by introducing the theoretical background of joint models and their relevance in clinical research. We then demonstrated how to fit univariate and multivariate joint models using {JM}, and {joineR} packages. We also discussed the importance of functional forms in joint models and how to specify them in the model fitting process. Additionally, we explored dynamic predictions and predictive accuracy metrics, such as ROC curves, calibration plots, and Brier scores. Finally, we introduced the concept of competing risks and illustrated how to fit joint models for competing risks data.\n",
