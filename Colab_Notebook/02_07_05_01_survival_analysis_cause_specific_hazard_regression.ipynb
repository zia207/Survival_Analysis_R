It is ideal for understanding etiology or mechanisms but should be complemented with cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) for risk prediction. This tutorial demonstrated how to fit, interpret, and visualize cause-specific hazard models using the `riskRegression` package in R, providing a practical framework for analyzing competing risks data.
