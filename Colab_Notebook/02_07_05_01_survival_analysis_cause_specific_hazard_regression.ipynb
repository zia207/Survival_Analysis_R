The CIF is then derived by integrating the cause-specific hazards with the overall survival function. Coefficients represent hazard ratios for the effect of covariates on the event rate. It is ideal for etiologic questions (understanding causal mechanisms) but does not directly model absolute risks, which can lead to indirect interpretations in prediction.

These matrices preserve the original ordering of `newdata` and `times`.

    "**Cause-Specific Hazard Regression** is a foundational tool in competing risks analysis that models the instantaneous risk of a specific event type, treating other events as censoring. It is ideal for understanding etiology or mechanisms but should be complemented with cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) for risk prediction. This tutorial demonstrated how to fit, interpret, and visualize cause-specific hazard models using the `riskRegression` package in R, providing a practical framework for analyzing competing risks data.  At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",
