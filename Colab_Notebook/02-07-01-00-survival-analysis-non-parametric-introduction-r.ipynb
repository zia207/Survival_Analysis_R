They offer intuitive, assumption-free estimates of survival probabilities and form the basis for hypothesis testing (e.g., log-rank test) and more advanced modeling (e.g., semi-parametric Cox models). Understanding these methods is essential for any survival data analysis. The next sections will demonstrate how to implement these methods in R, both manually and using the {survival} package."
