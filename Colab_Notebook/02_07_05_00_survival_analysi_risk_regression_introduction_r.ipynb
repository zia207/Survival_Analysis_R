    "Risk regression in survival analysis refers to a class of statistical models designed to estimate and predict the absolute risk (or probability) of an event occurring over time, often in the presence of competing risks—situations where multiple mutually exclusive events can prevent the event of interest from happening (e.g., death from other causes competing with disease relapse). Unlike traditional hazard-based models like the Cox proportional hazards model, which focus on the instantaneous rate of event occurrence (hazard), risk regression directly models the cumulative incidence function (CIF), which represents the marginal probability of the event accounting for competing risks and censoring. This approach is particularly useful for clinical prediction, as it provides interpretable absolute risks rather than relative hazards, and can incorporate time-dependent effects or use techniques like inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) or pseudo-observations to handle right-censoring. It can be applied in standard survival settings without competing risks by predicting risk as 1 minus the survival probability, but it is most prominently used in competing risks scenarios.\n"

The CIF is then derived by integrating the cause-specific hazards with the overall survival function. Coefficients represent hazard ratios for the effect of covariates on the event rate. It is ideal for etiologic questions (understanding causal mechanisms) but does not directly model absolute risks, which can lead to indirect interpretations in prediction. For example, in heart failure data, this approach might show no significant effect of cancer on cardiac death hazard.\n"

It is suited for prognostic purposes and absolute risk prediction, as predictions inherently respect the [0,1] probability bounds. In practice, it might reveal that a factor like cancer reduces the incidence of cardiac death by competing for non-cardiac outcomes.\n"
