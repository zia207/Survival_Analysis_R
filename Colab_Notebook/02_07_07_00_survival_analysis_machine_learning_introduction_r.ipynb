        "Machine Learning (ML) based Survival Analysis refers to the application of various machine learning algorithms and techniques to predict survival outcomes and model time-to-event data. Traditional statistical survival models (like Cox Proportional Hazards) have strong assumptions (e.g., proportional hazards, linearity) that might not always hold in complex real-world datasets with high-dimensional features or non-linear relationships. ML-based approaches offer greater flexibility to capture these complexities.\n",
