We'll use the `lung` dataset from the `survival` package in R, which contains data from a clinical trial on lung cancer patients. The tutorial is structured to guide you step-by-step, from theory to practical implementation. By the end, you'll be able to compute survival estimates, plot survival curves, and interpret results.\n"

This method is particularly useful for estimating the probability of survival over a specified time period, especially when dealing with censored data, which is common in medical research.\n",
    "\n",
    "To initiate our analysis, we start with the formula `Surv(futime, status) ~ 1`, where `time` represents the follow-up time until the event of interest or censoring occurs, and `status` indicates whether the event happened (usually coded as 1) or if the data is censored (coded as 0). The `survfit()` function utilizes this formula to calculate the Kaplan-Meier estimates, providing a stepwise approximation of the survival function. Additionally, the `summary()` function complements this analysis by offering a detailed summary of the survival estimates. Within this function, the `times` parameter allows researchers to specify particular time points at which they wish to view the survival probabilities. This feature is beneficial for focusing on time intervals of interest, enhancing the interpretability of the survival curves. Overall, these tools are essential for understanding patient survival trajectories and can inform clinical decision-making and research developments.\n"
