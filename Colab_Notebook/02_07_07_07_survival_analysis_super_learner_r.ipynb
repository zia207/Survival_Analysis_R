        "\n",
        "The **`survivalSL`** R package offers a comprehensive and flexible framework for **ensemble-based survival prediction** in the presence of **right-censored time-to-event data**. Built on the **Super Learner** algorithm—a theoretically optimal ensemble method—it combines diverse base learners, including **parametric models** (e.g., AFT and PH models with Gamma, Weibull, Gompertz, or generalized Gamma distributions), **semi-parametric Cox models** (standard, stepwise-selected, and penalized variants such as Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net), **flexible spline-based PH models** (Royston–Parmar), and **machine learning approaches** (Random Survival Forests and survival neural networks via the PLANN method). The package supports model evaluation using a wide range of prognostic metrics—including time-dependent AUC, concordance index, Brier score, and integrated likelihood-based measures—and provides tools for **cross-validated tuning**, **prediction**, and **calibration assessment** via intuitive plots. Designed for clinical and epidemiological research, `survivalSL` enables robust, data-adaptive survival modeling while maintaining interpretability and reproducibility.\n"
